_**Playtest & Feedback**_

**I recieved feedback from an anonymous classmate through Google Forms and my dad. From my classmates feedback, they described the emotion/feeling of the environment change as, "the emotion of being captured and trapped in a small place and then escaping for freedom". From their feedback it is evident that my intended emotion was felt and the word "freedom" is closely related to the second environment. The first improvement suggestion given by the classmate was to make the changes in environment look more obvious. My second testor was my mum. In describing the feeling, she "Felt lonely, it was a quiet and isolated place, compared to the other environment, I felt it was a peaceful, beautiful and had a sense of calmness and serenity". Both feedbacks overall sensed my main intended emotions and changes between the environments, however I did not receive many improvements. By watching the playtest, I noticed some areas where the user could bypass my road blocker by going through a building, this being a Mesh Collider issue which I have resolved now. Below is a screen recording of his playtest.**

<!-- 1. Ask a friend, family member, classmate or someone else to playtest your work. Give them a set amount of time to explore your environment, and don't give them any instructions about where to go or what to do.  
2. Using a screen recording method of your choice, create a screen recording of their testing of your work. Use this recording to improve your design by looking for elements that may be confusing, overlooked, or otherwise in need of adjustment.
3. Post this recording to your blog, and write a post detailing the testing session, including who your tester was, what the results of the session were, and how the results will inform the design of your project moving forward.
