**Greybox Progress**

**For this class I used a draft environment that I had designed which was not entirely related to my final design, as my greybox prototype was not completed. Now that my greybox prototype is completed, the only landmark that is missing is the gazebo.**
<!-- 2. Based on the playtesting session from today's class, and the principles discussed in the lecture, iterate on your greybox prototype by establishing your approach to proportion, form/void relationships, and other elements of spatial composition.
3. Once the entire environment is roughly blocked out in this fashion, you may steadily replace your primitives with the final assets over the remainder of the project. Ensure that you add appropriate mesh colliders to these assets, as per the above video tutorial.
4. Continue to rigorously document this process on your blog, and iterate on your design document with any changes that you need to make to either your concept or project. Document and justify these changes as you go.
