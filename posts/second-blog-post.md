_**Editing Experiment**_

**I attempted to create a video that incorporated a few different transitions such as jump cuts and one match cut in the form of a montage, rather than it having a defined concept or storyline. The first two scenes I intended for them to be a match cut with the camera facing upwards in both, depicting a cityscape and the other a trail of trees. I feel that it was not entirely successful as I could have used a wider range of cuts depending on the soundtrack choice which I also tried to align with the transitions and pace of each clip.**
