_**Key Moment**_

**The symphonic melody in my key moment is held and sustained, in order to articulate the richness of small details. I strived to firstly bring the viewers attention to a close up shot of the flower to then later display the multitude of them that were unfocused. It allows for gratification towards less rather than many, as less is more and the delicate nature of the flora with the idea of less is more, correlates to my personal attribute of simplicity and gentlessness in all aspects of my life, appreciating the smallest of details. In order to establish pacing and rhythm that corresponds to the chosen soundtrack, I filmed this scene slowly and simply with a right pan, as well as a synchresis, an alignment between the tranquil symphony soundtrack and slow visual pan. The soundtrack is my original composition, which is set at an at ease tempo.**
