**Environment Concept**

**Blossom Plant, Gazebo, bench seat rest, gazebo represents rest as well river symbols. The visualisation of my environment concept was constructed as I thought about how I felt in one area of life compared to the other. 
The use of a bridge to change environment, starts in a cyberpunk city. The sound is attached to the rest bench chair, as it signifies how I feel at rest at my current stage of life. While every day comes with its difficulties, I am content and thankful that I have found the course that suits my passions and interests without having to feel overwhelmed and tense.**
