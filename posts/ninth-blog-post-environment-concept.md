_**Environment Concept**_

**The concept of Bloom began from the idea of new beginnings and growth, which is represented by the main feature, the Blossom Plant beneath the gazebo, also a symbol of rest. Cherry Blossoms hold an important significance in my environment, symbolising the unexpected nature of change in life, which enables us to grow and start afresh, a new beginning, a season of yearning and renewal. I was inspired by a few photos that were previously taken by myself a few years back of blossoms and a Japanese garden at the Olinda Tea House. The blossoms are at full bloom in spring, which is another symbol of growth, renewal and hope for a better future. Additionally, the bumpy and smooth texture of the path portrays lifes struggles and relates back to the idea of uncertainty amidst the blossoms of life. On the other hand the bench seat represents rest, similarly to the river that is accompanied by gentle and peaceful sounds of flowing water. The main soundtrack is attached to the rest bench chair, as it signifies how I feel at rest at my current stage of life, peaceful.**

**The concept for my environment was constructed as I visualised and thought about how I felt in one area of life compared to the other. This leads to the use of a bridge to change environment, inspired by the image below. My environment starts in a cyberpunk type city, full of highrise buildings, purposefully included to display the characteristics of intimidation, suppression and overwhelmingness. The path through the city is not linear. As the player moves through, it is noticeable how corners are not visible until you turn and discover no through way, represnting how unpredictable my course was and moving forward was strugglesome. The music is quite inspirational and uplifiting in my second environment however here in the city it begins tense and futuristic, sounding slightly uneasy from the fast paced melody. While every day comes with its difficulties, I am content and thankful that I have found the course that suits my passions and interests without having to feel overwhelmed and tense.**
