_**Artist Statement Draft**_

**Hello and welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Evanthia (Eva) Evgenidis and I am a first year Design Student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). From a young age I have had a passion for expressing my emotions and thoughts through design using a diverse range of visual arts, such as painting, sketching, photography, videography and crafts. Presently, I am beginning to discover my areas of interest and techniques in design, while also representing my originality and personality throughout it. My journey as a creative practitioner in design began with the production of a variety of design projects which entailed distinct design modes and techniques, including videography, sound composition, film editing, two-dimensional graphic design, three-dimensional environment design and finally website design. Across all my projects I have remained with the theme of growth, peace, tranquility and hope. Creatively, I strive for audiences to feel calm and intrigued by the appreciation of nature through design, building a connection between my admiration and love for nature to the wider community of viewers to also find wonder in the smaller details. Nature is a common feature within each of my projects as well as my favoured colour palette, consisting of the colour green, pink and white or cream.

During the course of this semester I have utilised multiple softwares which were new to me. 

<!-- What are the themes, techniques, interests,
and ideas that are common across your work?
• This will start to give you a sense of where your interests and tastes lie as a creative
practitioner. You can also reflect on your experiences this semester: which project did
you enjoy producing the most, and why? Are there any ideas or pieces of software that
you plan on investigating further?
• Answering these kind of questions can help you to articulate what you might like to
specialise in later on in the program, not only in terms of broad categories (digital video,
digital sound, digital environments, or web) but also in terms of more specific focuses.
• The biography is also the place for you to distinguish yourself in terms of more personal
touches and details, should be written in such a way as to introduce or conclude the
rest of your webpage, rather than being a standalone statement. --> -->


_**Wireframe Drafts**_

<!-- 2. Using the skills developed so far in the tutorials, implement as much of this content as you can in Figma. Don't worry too much about the layout or organisation for now.

In tandem with this, focus on how you can use various visual elements to express your interests and tastes as an artist or designer. Document and comment on this process in a blog post. --> -->
