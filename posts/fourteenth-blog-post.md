_**Artist Statement Draft**_

**Hello and welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Evanthia (Eva) Evgenidis and I am a first year Design Student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). From a young age I have had a passion for expressing my emotions and thoughts through design using a diverse range of visual arts, such as painting, sketching, photography, videography and crafts. Presently, I am beginning to discover my areas of interest and techniques in design, while also representing my originality and personality throughout it. My journey as a creative practitioner in design began with the production of a variety of design projects which entailed distinct design modes and techniques, including videography, sound composition, film editing, two-dimensional graphic design, three-dimensional environment design and finally website design. Across all my projects I have remained with the theme of growth, peace, tranquility and hope. Creatively, I strive for audiences to feel calm and intrigued by the appreciation of nature through design, building a connection between my admiration and love for nature to the wider community of viewers to also find wonder in the smaller details. Nature is a common feature within each of my projects as well as my favoured colour palette, consisting of the colour green, pink and white or cream.**

**During the course of this semester in Digital Media Studio 1, I have utilised multiple softwares which were new to me. The softwares which I am progressively learning the techniques for include many of the Adobe Creative Suite and more. Specifically, Visual Studio Code, Adobe Premiere Pro and Illustrator, Unity and Figma. These softwares were an introduction to each area in design which I thoroughly enjoyed using and am anticipating to further my knowledge in all, however with a focus more towards Figma and Visual Studio Code. I anticipate on specialising in website design and UX/UI design. In regards to my future aspirations of web design my approach with the layout and style of this webpage was inspired by the classical and impressionism art movement which I have articulated in my webpage. Both represent my interest and appreciation of classical, poetic and elegant design which embody my personality. Specifically, I have attempted to closely base my design from Claude Monet and his artwork due to a connection in my first project from the Digital Media Studio 1: Production course. As I cointinue this expedition through design and digital media I hope my creative ideas and productions portray my soft and poetic styles and how there is more in less, as the smallest of details can make an immense impact through the expression of emotion, nature and personality through design.**

<!-- 2. Using the skills developed so far in the tutorials, implement as much of this content as you can in Figma. Don't worry too much about the layout or organisation for now.

In tandem with this, focus on how you can use various visual elements to express your interests and tastes as an artist or designer. Document and comment on this process in a blog post. --> -->
