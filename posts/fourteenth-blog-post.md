snippet: WEEK 10 - SESSION 2

---

<!-- 1. Based on your answers to the self reflection questions from the last session, begin to formalise the written components of your folio webpage into a series of paragraphs that will frame your work and progress over the semester in a clear, accessible, and engaging manner. 

2. Using the skills developed so far in the tutorials, implement as much of this content as you can in Figma. Don't worry too much about the layout or organisation for now.

3. If you haven't already, write a first draft of your artist or designer bio. In tandem with this, focus on how you can use various visual elements to express your interests and tastes as an artist or designer. Document and comment on this process in a blog post. -->
