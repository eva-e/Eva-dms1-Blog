_**Artist Statement Draft**_
**I was inspired by the classical and impressionism art movement which I have articulated in my webpage. Both represent my interest and appreciation of classical and elegant design which embody my personality. Specifically, I have attempted to closely base my design from Claude Monet and his artwork due to a connection in my first project from the Digital Media Studio 1: Production course. The reason behind adding an artwork by Claude Monet called, The Water-Lily Pond, is because of the nature and bridge. The bridge is represented in my third assignment as new beginnings and the lily pond in my first as growth, purposefully building a connection between my projects in order to emphasise my admiration for both classical art and the appreciation of nature through design. I gained inspiration from the Claude Monet painting above my piano and the idea of new beginnings in my 3D digital environment.**
<!-- A biography is a detailed description of someone’s life. An artist or designer bio is a
focused description of an artist or designer’s career.
• After you’ve had some practice writing statements for individual works, you can gather
them together and look for any patterns. What are the themes, techniques, interests,
and ideas that are common across your work?
• This will start to give you a sense of where your interests and tastes lie as a creative
practitioner. You can also reflect on your experiences this semester: which project did
you enjoy producing the most, and why? Are there any ideas or pieces of software that
you plan on investigating further?
• Answering these kind of questions can help you to articulate what you might like to
specialise in later on in the program, not only in terms of broad categories (digital video,
digital sound, digital environments, or web) but also in terms of more specific focuses.
• The biography is also the place for you to distinguish yourself in terms of more personal
touches and details, should be written in such a way as to introduce or conclude the
rest of your webpage, rather than being a standalone statement. -->

_**Wireframe Drafts**_
<!-- 1. Based on your answers to the self reflection questions from the last session, begin to formalise the written components of your folio webpage into a series of paragraphs that will frame your work and progress over the semester in a clear, accessible, and engaging manner. 

2. Using the skills developed so far in the tutorials, implement as much of this content as you can in Figma. Don't worry too much about the layout or organisation for now.

3. If you haven't already, write a first draft of your artist or designer bio. In tandem with this, focus on how you can use various visual elements to express your interests and tastes as an artist or designer. Document and comment on this process in a blog post. -->
