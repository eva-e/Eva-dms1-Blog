**In order to articulate my designs I further searched for synonyms of the given words, applying the element of Define from the design thinking process. I then began to ideate designs that I believed expressed the given words from my perspective. For example, the word order signified a design which composed of black squares aligned and accurately spaced next to each other. The black square was created by using the rectangle tool and holding shift to expand the rectangle into a perfect square. Another skilled applied while using Adobe Illustrator was layering, where I named each layer in accordance with the specific word I was working on for the designs, however at times I forgot to change layers which is a skill in progress.**
