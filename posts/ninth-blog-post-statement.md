**Statement**

**Bloom, the title of my 3D digital environment, is derived from my growth and expereince in transfering from an Information Technology (IT) Degree last year, to Design (Digital Media) this year. I found IT complex and overwhelming, reminding me of a cyberpunk city, coding continually and feeling a decline in my creative abilities, as they were being suppressed. At the same time I loved coding, however backend coding lacked elements of my passion which are art and design. I based one side of the environment on a city and on the other hand, my changed environment is based on a tranquil setting, filled with nature, cherry blossom and bonsai trees, a river and a resting bech seat, signifying how my heart is now at rest in the current degree.**
