**In this class I started experimenting with Unity. First I created a project using the 3D Core Template, as the project's focus is on a 3D environment. The activity was to start using shapes in Unity such as the cube from 3D Objects. After getting the feel of positioning the object and resizing it, I next attempted to make a simple replica of the solar system, based off the website Solar System Scope. This time starting with the Sphere from 3D objects and importing textures to place onto the spheres, corresponding to each planet and star. Below I have included screenshots of my experiment:**
