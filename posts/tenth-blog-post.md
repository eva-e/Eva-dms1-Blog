_**Greybox Prototype**_

**My greybox prototype was constructed based on my drawn environment map concept. I used a range of cubes, cuboids and columns, to establish paths and structures. I also generated the raised terrain areas using the terrain tool. In order to distingush differences between the two environments, I painted one side of the terrain green to signify grass compared to the grey cement texture of the city terrain.**

<!-- 2. Using the design documents that you generated for your last homework task, and the navigation design concepts explored in class today, block out your environment design in Unity. 
3. Start with basic primitives such as cubes and spheres to establish landmarks, paths, and other spatial design elements. You may also use the terrain tool for outdoor environments. 
4. Work quickly and roughly to ensure that you have a simple greybox prototype for the next class, and so you can start testing and iterating as soon as possible.
