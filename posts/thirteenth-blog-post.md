**Assignment 1 Video Edit**
## How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?
**My concept for the video edit was based on nature, surrounding the idea of a connection between symphonic instumental melodies and nature, specifically flowers. I attempted to create a melody which was calm and inspiring, similar to the stillness of the nature featured in my video.**

## How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?
**In order to decide and consider certain footage that would be used in my project, I first articulated the main concept and meaning behind the video which is centred on the meaning of my name, Evanthia, flower; blossom. After I had thought about my concept I was then able to target and decide on footage that captured nature and flora, which shaped my project entirely. Another aspect of my project was the relation to Claude Monet. As I was composing the soundtrack, I constantly noticed the Water-Lily painting above my piano, this being another inspiration applied in the final video.**

## What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?
**Sound isn't as simple as a few instruments put together to create a melody, it is more than the instrument, as it delves into the emotional appeal to listeners, each interpreting it differently however universally we all sense a common emotion in a particular melody or soundtrack. The power of sound within my video varied in terms of the volume levels and the emotional sense. I learnt that there can be a balance between sound effects and soundtrack, in which the focus is taken away from one or the other at times throughout the video. The layering of sound also played a key part in my video as I increased the sound effect at moments where the stillness of natural sounds can be appreciated more. Additionally the main soundtrack, Bloom, a symphonic melody, played throughout the video in order to shape the emotional experience on a classical and tranquil level.**

## How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?
**When putting together a video featuring sound and visuals, the concept of pacing and rhythm is crucial to developing the story or meaning behind the video in a fluid manner. The pacing in my edit is moderately slow, as I anticipated the video to feel elegant, calm and tranquil, avoided a fast paced video, as the main theme and concepts would not correlate with rapid jump cuts. I utilised jump cuts and a couple of fade to black transitions to enhance the overall peaceful flow of the video. In terms of editing, the timing of each scene closley matched to increase continuity and also allow the viewer to view the scenes equally, at a slow pace.**

## Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait? What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?
**I focused on my personality and interests, rather than potential future. The concept of flowers and relation to my name, depict the softness of my personality and my values and qualities of sincerity, honesty, selflessness, kindness, humility and compassion. I expressed my personality and interests through the visuals of flowers and the soundtrack. The soundtrack was a meaningful addition to the video as I composed it to signify my interest in classical art, music and elegant design styles, while also incorporating the Claude Monet artwork. I chose to depict how classicl music, art and flowers can be expressed through design as they embody characteristics from an era of the past, which I deeply appreciate and admire, as well as the symbolic meaning of flowers in my video, being hope and appreciation of the smaller details.**

**Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons**

## How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?
**When I first began to choose the theme for the suite of icons, I was drawn towards the theme of calm. Throughout all my projects I have drifted towards themes of peace, tranquility and growth as they realte to my interests, personality, past and new beginnings for the future. Generating ideas in terms of 9 different icons that represent and embody the theme of calm was difficult at first, as I was looking at the world literally rather than metaphorically and emotionally. At first I thought of the general dove, meditation and leaf symbols of calmness however they were too common and didn't evoke an originality based on my own interpretation and emotion. I finally developed 9 icons with the idea of my personal interests and favourable things, such as the dango, a japanese dessert, which is one of my favourites, especially the combination of colours in the dessert. The idea of a dessert synbolising calm, alongside a dessert of my liking, is how I continued to develop my icons, relating back to myself. I continued through with sub themes such as, tea, dessert, nature, weather, plants, home, peace, rest and home.** 

## Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?
**Certainly I started with researching words and synonyms of calm, which benefited my final suite of icons as I was able to develop multiple sub themes. With the synonyms I also went towards the general calm symbols approach, in which I became too focused on the generic and common symbols, rather than capturing an original concept. I chose an original approach as it truly displayed my own interests and likings, compared to the common well known side of producing these icons from the theme calm. There are aspects of other my projects interwined in my icons suite, creating the flow of my artistry.**

 ## How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?
 **Through illustrator I was able to both translate my thumbnail sketches into final flat design and add more detail to some of them. Using the pen tool for all my designs and shapes, enabled me to create simple and neat flat designs. It took a while to build confidence in using the pen tool, however the more I drafted and experimented with my designs I soon was able to produce decent designs. I closely looked attempted to duplicate my sketch and illustrator design in terms of the line and shape of each icon, while a few I adjusted and altered, keeping a soft style, compared to the pencil drawn sketch.**

## Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?
**I believe there was only one icon where I changed it entirely compared to my thumbnail sketch which is the "rest" sub theme. Instead of a bed and lamp, I changed this design to only a lamp for the final flat design as I intended to focus on how different lighting can change the atmosphere of a room and produce the feeling of calmness. My other icons gained additional details and refinement.**

## How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons?
**My icons encompass a range of colours from a colour palette I selected and used a colour generator to generate more shades. I started with green, pink, cream and brown. Green and pink relates to the colours of the dango dessert and tea. The other colours reminded me of soft/neutral shades that create a warm or calm ambience in a home or can also be derived from food colours. From these base colours I inputted them into Coolors, which generated more shades for each colour, providing my icons with a set of 10 colours where I also altered a few in the process of colouring the icons.**

## Why did you choose the palette that you did?
**This colour palette correlated with my idea of food and the cozy feeling of rain, reading and a homely presence. The inspiration for the base colours came from dango, tea and other foods. While my initial thought was based on food and desserts I was able to incorporate this colour palette into my non food related icons, such as the lotus, rain cloud, book, lamp, sakura, tea, seashell and plant.**

## How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?
**

**How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?**

**Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment**
**How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?**
**How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?**
**What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?**
**How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?**
**How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain themeor concept?**
**How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?**
**What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?**

_**Webpage Ideation**_
**I was inspired by the classical and impressionism art movement which I have articulated in my webpage. Both represent my interest and appreciation of classical and elegant design which embody my personality. Specifically, I have attempted to closely base my design from Claude Monet and his artwork due to a connection in my first project from the Digital Media Studio 1: Production course. The reason behind adding an artwork by Claude Monet called, The Water-Lily Pond, is because of the nature and bridge. The bridge is represented in my third assignment as new beginnings and the lily pond in my first as growth, purposefully building a connection between my projects in order to emphasise my admiration for both classical art and the appreciation of nature through design. I gained inspiration from the Claude Monet painting above my piano and the idea of new beginnings in my 3D digital environment.**
