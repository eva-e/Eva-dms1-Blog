**Assignment 1 Video Edit**
## How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?
**My concept for the video edit was based on nature, surrounding the idea of a connection between symphonic instumental melodies and nature, specifically flowers. I attempted to create a melody which was calm and inspiring, similar to the stillness of the nature featured in my video.**

## How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?
**In order to decide and consider certain footage that would be used in my project, I first articulated the main concept and meaning behind the video which is centred on the meaning of my name, Evanthia, flower; blossom. After I had thought about my concept I was then able to target and decide on footage that captured nature and flora, which shaped my project entirely. Another aspect of my project was the relation to Claude Monet. As I was composing the soundtrack, I constantly noticed the Water-Lily painting above my piano, this being another inspiration applied in the final video.**

## What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?
**Sound isn't as simple as a few instruments put together to create a melody, it is more than the instrument, as it delves into the emotional appeal to listeners, each interpreting it differently however universally we all sense a common emotion in a particular melody or soundtrack. The power of sound within my video varied in terms of the volume levels and the emotional sense. I learnt that there can be a balance between sound effects and soundtrack, in which the focus is taken away from one or the other at times throughout the video. The layering of sound also played a key part in my video as I increased the sound effect at moments where the stillness of natural sounds can be appreciated more. Additionally the main soundtrack, Bloom, a symphonic melody, played throughout the video in order to shape the emotional experience on a classical and tranquil level.**

## How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?
**When putting together a video featuring sound and visuals, the concept of pacing and rhythm is crucial to developing the story or meaning behind the video in a fluid manner. The pacing in my edit is moderately slow, as I anticipated the video to feel elegant, calm and tranquil, avoided a fast paced video, as the main theme and concepts would not correlate with rapid jump cuts. I utilised jump cuts and a couple of fade to black transitions to enhance the overall peaceful flow of the video. In terms of editing, the timing of each scene closley matched to increase continuity and also allow the viewer to view the scenes equally, at a slow pace.**

## Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait? What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?
**

**Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons**
**How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?**
**Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?** **How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator?**
**Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?**
**How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? **Why did you choose the palette that you did?**
**How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?**
**How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?**

**Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment**
**How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?**
**How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?**
**What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?**
**How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?**
**How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain themeor concept?**
**How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?**
**What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?**

**I was inspired by the classical and impressionism art movement which I have articulated in my webpage. Both represent my interest and appreciation of classical and elegant design which embody my personality. Specifically, I have attempted to closely base my design from Claude Monet and his artwork due to a connection in my first project from the Digital Media Studio 1: Production course. The reason behind adding an artwork by Claude Monet called, The Water-Lily Pond, is because of the nature and bridge. The bridge is represented in my third assignment as new beginnings and the lily pond in my first as growth, purposefully building a connection between my projects in order to emphasise my admiration for both classical art and the appreciation of nature through design. I gained inspiration from the Claude Monet painting above my piano and the idea of new beginnings in my 3D digital environment.**

<!-- 1. In a blog post, answer the self reflection questions from the lecture in as much detail as you can. 

2. Consider which pieces of process documentation and reflection will best communicate your personal, technical, and conceptual progress across the semester so far. 

3. Begin to plan out the overall structure of your webpage, and consider how you will distribute this information across a timeline of the semester. Summarise this thought process in a blog post, and include responses to the following questions:

     - What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
     - Who is the target audience?
     - What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?

4. Write a first draft of an artist statement for each of your projects: some useful tips for doing so can be found hereLinks to an external site..  -->
